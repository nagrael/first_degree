ThingSpeak Java Client 
===
A Java client for the [ThingSpeak](http://thingspeak.com) Internet of Things.
Implements all aspects of the ThingSpeak API and can be used to update channel
data, retrieve and examine feeds, and query public channels.  It supports the
hosted ThingSpeak server at api.thingspeak.com as well as self-hosted
open-source servers ([GitHub Source](https://github.com/iobridge/thingspeak)). 

Also included:  An appender for log4j - post data to ThingSpeak channels using
Logger framework.

How To Install
---
Get the source by [downloading a zip
file](https://github.com/angryelectron/thingspeak-java/archive/master.zip) or
by cloning the git repository
https://github.com/angryelectron/thingspeak-java.git .  Building the source
requires the Java 7 SDK and Apache Ant, or use the [Netbeans
IDE](http://netbeans.org). 

Here is an example of how to install the client from the command line in
Ubuntu/Debian/Raspbian with a minimal build environment:

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get -y install openjdk-7-jdk git ant
git clone https://github.com/angryelectron/thingspeak-java.git
cd thingspeak-java
ant
```

To run optional tests, run 'ant test'.  Due to the rate limit of the public
Thingspeak server (15sec), tests can take a long time to run.  After building,
the jars, docs, and dependencies can be found in thingspeak/dist.

How To Use
---
Add thingspeak-x.y.jar to your project and the following dependencies:

* [Unirest](http://unirest.io) 
* [GSON](http://code.google.com/p/google-gson/) 

Dependencies can be found in thingspeak/dist/lib after building the source.
Refer to the included javadocs for more details.  The [ThingSpeak API
Documentation](http://community.thingspeak.com/documentation/api/#thingspeak_api)
is also a good source of additional information about using the API.

If you encounter any issues with the ThingSpeak Java Client, please use the
[GitHub issue
tracker](https://github.com/angryelectron/thingspeak-java/issues).

Examples
---
Here is how to write "hello" to field1 of ThingSpeak public channel 1234. 

```
String apiWriteKey = "your-channel-write-key";
Channel channel = new Channel(1234, apiWriteKey);

Entry entry = new Entry();
entry.setField(1, "hello");
channel.update(entry);
```

And here is how to read it back:

```
Channel channel = new Channel(1234);
Entry entry = channel.getLastChannelEntry();
System.out.println(entry.getField(1);
```

Please refer to thingspeak/dist/javadoc for more information about customzing
channel feeds, searching public channels, using open-source servers, and all
the other operations supported by the ThingSpeak API.

log4j Appender
---
Use log4j to update ThingSpeak channels.  Date, Level, and Message are
'fields', written as an 'entry'.  Setup a new ThingSpeak channel with these
three fields, then pass the channel number and API write-key to the appender.

Here's how to configure the appender and send a test 
message (just add your own channelNumber and apiWriteKey):

```
ThingSpeakAppender appender = new ThingSpeakAppender();
appender.configureChannel(channelNumber, apiWriteKey, "http://api.thingspeak.com");
appender.setThreshold(Level.INFO);
appender.activateOptions();
Logger.getRootLogger().addAppender(appender);
Logger.getLogger(this.getClass()).log(Level.INFO, "Hello World");
```

You can also configure the appender via log4j.properties:

```
log4j.rootLogger=INFO, ThingSpeak
log4j.appender.ThingSpeak=com.angryelectron.thingspeak.log4j.ThingSpeakAppender
com.angryelectron.thingspeak.log4j.channelNumber = YOUR_CHANNEL_NUMBER
com.angryelectron.thingspeak.log4j.apiWriteKey = YOUR_API_WRITE_KEY
```
To use your own server (other than api.thingspeak.com):

```
com.angryelectron.thingspeak.log4j.server = YOUR_THINGSPEAK_SERVER_URL
```

See the javadocs for more details.
